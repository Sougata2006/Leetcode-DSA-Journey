# Leetcode-DSA-Journey


This repository contains my Java solutions to various Leetcode problems.

Each file is named using the problem number and title for easy reference.  
I use this space to keep track of the problems I solve whenever I get time — there’s no fixed schedule or regular update.

The main purpose of this repo is personal practice and to maintain a record of my progress. The code is mostly straightforward with minimal documentation, focused on solving the problems efficiently.

Feel free to browse through the solutions if it helps you in any way.
